1a)
A class is a template to create objects. For example, the class for a manager would include a field for his/her details and salary. An instantation of a class is when an object is created. For example, adding a manager to the program creates an instance of the manager class containing the manager's name and salary.

b)
One way inheritance can be used in the program is by creating the manager and sales personnel classes by extending the office staff class. Another way is to create a sale class and extend that for different payment types, such as direct payment or installment payment.

c)
Libraries have predefined classes, which can cut the work needed to create the programs by a significant amount.
