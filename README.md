1a)
A class is a template to create objects. For example, the class for a manager would include a field for his/her details and salary. An instantation of a class is when an object is created. For example, adding a manager to the program creates an instance of the manager class containing the manager's name and salary.

b)
One way inheritance can be used in the program is by creating the manager and sales personnel classes by extending the office staff class. Another way is to create a sale class and extend that for different payment types, such as direct payment or installment payment.

c)
Libraries have predefined classes, which can cut the work needed to create the programs by a significant amount.

2b)
So the attributes can remain private and cannot be changed externally.

cii)
If a sale needs to be changed, for example because of a typo when first entered, there will be no way to do it.

d) There will be no output as the getSalesHistory method is not created yet. After it is created, the output is:

102

2

2550.4

5000.0

h) 
Add a new attribute to the Sales class to put in the date. It's also possible to add a temporary list to the SalesPerson class to store the current month's sale only, although it's optional.

i) There is no inheritance, so there is no overriding. For overloading, there are 2 constructors in the SalesPerson class
